**Smart Space is a high-secure, blockchain-based, decentralized data cloud storage driven by PoS and masternodes.**
Apart from running masternodes and staking, the SmartSpace platform will be used for any purposes of data storage and transfer (for example, decentralized websites, encrypted files, file exchange systems, etc.)
SmartSpace is a promising blockchain-based, decentralized cloud storage with bright prospects of growing into a smart-contract platform for app and website development.
